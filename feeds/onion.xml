As an author, I can bring to life strange, wondrous characters and have them say or do anything I want.

What could be more amazing than that?</p><p>When I sit down to write, I let my creativity run wild, populating my fiction with principled men and women who roam august â€œcourtroomsâ€ in outlandish three-piece suits and deliver arguments based on arcane knowledge they have gleaned from dusty old tomes.

And if we cannot have 18- to 34-year-olds, we have decided that no one can.â€ At press time, the bloodshed showed no sign of abating as Snuggle now set its sights on 35- to 44-year-olds ...</p>

                <p>BROOKLINE, MAâ€”Chomping at the bit to twist the benign statement into an absolutely terrifying image, the subconscious of local man David Vanwell reportedly couldnâ€™t wait Monday to turn an offhand remark by his boss into a dream about a drowning horse. â€œOh yeah, as soon as he falls asleep Iâ€™m going to manifest that frivolous comment from the earlier meeting into a horrifying visual of a stallion vainly flailing for its life as it slowly disappears underwater,â€ said Vanwellâ€™s psyche, excitedly planning every detail of the panicked horseâ€™s descent to a watery grave that will somehow represent his supervisorâ€™s innocuous observation. â€œIâ€™ve been waiting for the perfect excuse to drop a stallion in an above-ground swimming pool where it can sink down, down, down as if to the bottom of the ocean even though the pool itself is only six feet high, and ...</p>
